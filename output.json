    "Jury Learning": "Jury learning is an approach within supervised machine learning that aims to explicitly resolve disagreements about labels in datasets by using a metaphor of a jury. In traditional supervised learning, disagreements among labelers are often resolved implicitly through majority vote, potentially overriding minority opinions. Jury learning, however, allows for the composition of a 'jury' of labelers to be specified, ensuring that the final classification decision reflects a more deliberate choice of whose opinions to consider.\n\nEach labeler in the dataset is modeled individually, and for a given input example, a jury is composed by sampling labelers based on specified characteristics. The jury learning architecture predicts how each juror would label the example, and a median-of-means outcome is determined from multiple jury compositions. This approach not only makes the decision-making process more transparent but also allows for exploring how different compositions might affect the classification outcome. It is particularly beneficial in contexts where societal disagreements on labels exist, offering a structured way to integrate diverse viewpoints into machine learning models.",
    "Labeler Population": "In machine learning datasets, particularly in tasks involving subjective judgment, labeler population can significantly influence the model's understanding and output. The labeler population refers to the group of individuals who provide labels for training data. Diverse labeler populations are essential for capturing a broad range of perspectives, especially in tasks where societal or cultural viewpoints may diverge.\n\nJury learning emphasizes understanding and explicitly managing the composition of this labeler population. By acknowledging that different groups (e.g., based on demographics, expertise) may have varying opinions on the correct labels, jury learning allows practitioners to compose juries that balance or prioritize these differences. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that might inadvertently prioritize the majority opinion, potentially leading to models that do not adequately represent minority viewpoints.",
    "Predicted Juror Labels": "Predicted juror labels in the context of jury learning are the outcomes of individual labeler models within the dataset. Each labeler is modeled separately, and for a given input, the system predicts how each selected juror (labeler) would label that input. This process is crucial for jury learning as it allows for the aggregation of diverse perspectives into a collective decision.\n\nThe prediction of juror labels involves sampling different combinations of labelers based on the specified jury composition and running trials to predict their labels for the input example. These individual predictions are then used to determine the final classification through a consensus mechanism, such as a median-of-means outcome. This approach ensures that the decision-making process considers a wider array of opinions, potentially leading to more nuanced and representative classification outcomes.",
    "Jury Classification": "Jury classification in the framework of jury learning refers to the final decision made by aggregating the outcomes of multiple jury trials. Each trial consists of a jury, a group of labelers sampled from the dataset, predicting labels for a given input example. The jury classification process aggregates these predictions to produce a final label for the input.\n\nThis aggregation often involves calculating the median-of-means jury outcome from the trials, providing a robust measure that reflects the central tendency of the jury's decisions. By surfacing the median jury outcome over multiple trials, the system allows decision-makers to explore and understand the variability in jury decisions. This method enhances the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning models to account for diverse perspectives and reduces the risk of marginalizing minority opinions.",
    "Selected Jury Composition": "The selected jury composition in jury learning is a critical aspect that determines which labelers from the dataset are chosen to form a jury for ruling on an input example. The composition is defined by the machine learning practitioner based on desired characteristics, such as demographic groups, expertise, or any other relevant criteria. This deliberate composition of the jury aims to reflect the diversity of opinions or prioritize certain viewpoints over others.\n\nBy allowing practitioners to specify the characteristics of labelers who make up the jury, jury learning introduces a structured way to integrate diverse or targeted perspectives into the decision-making process. This approach contrasts with traditional methods where such specificity and intentionality in selecting labelers are often lacking. The selected jury composition, therefore, plays a crucial role in ensuring that the final classification decision aligns with the intended representation of views, enhancing the model's fairness and inclusivity.",
    "Unseen Example": "An unseen example in machine learning refers to a new input that the model encounters during inference, which was not part of the training data. In the context of jury learning, the unseen example is the input on which the composed jury is asked to rule. The ability to accurately classify unseen examples is crucial for the practical applicability of machine learning models, as it demonstrates the model's generalization capability.\n\nIn jury learning, the unseen example is presented to the model, and the jury learning architecture predicts how each juror in the selected composition would label this example. Through multiple trials with re-sampled jurors, the system aggregates these predictions to reach a final classification decision. This process emphasizes the model's ability to incorporate diverse perspectives and make informed decisions on new inputs, highlighting the dynamic and adaptable nature of jury learning in handling real-world variability."
